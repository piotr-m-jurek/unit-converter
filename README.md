# unit converter

- Unit converter built as part of Roadmap.sh project.
- Link to [roadmap.sh/projects/unit-converter](https://roadmap.sh/projects/unit-converter)

## Key Features

- Used Golang + HTMX to learn more about htmx, and structuring the code in golang
- i still want to use ocaml with dream and htmx to build it, but golang seemed to be easier option for learning purposes
